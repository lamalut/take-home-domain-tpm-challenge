# Take Home Business Apps Scenario Challenge for Technical Program Manager

We are a practical team at Microsoft and this extends to the way that we work with you to find out if this team is a great fit for you. We want you to come away with a great understanding of the work that we actually do day to day and what it is like to work with us.

So instead of asking you to provide customer or product examples on the spot during interview, which is not a thing we often do, we instead discuss a scenario, trend or piece of feedback that you have written previously when we meet.



## Guidelines

This is meant to be an assignment that you spend approximately three hours of dedicated, focused work. Do not feel like you need to overengineer the write-up with dozens of hours to impress us. Be biased toward quality over quantity.



## The Problem

Our team understands customer scenarios, trends and friction between customer vision and Microsoft products. We communicate these regularly both in writing and verbally.

Provide a brief writeup describing either a customer scenario, market trend or point of friction with Microsoft Business Applications or competitor product (Dynamics 365, Power Platform), or  overall low code/no code customer scenario for a professional developer persona.

- Write a minimum of one paragraph and a maximum of one page.
- Include a one-sentence catchy executive summary sentence.



Good luck! Please send a link or document back to us at least 48 hours before your interview so we can review it before we speak.
